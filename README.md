# Web-socket-app
Node express web socket server with a React client

To use the app first go to the server folder and type "node app.js" to start up the server. After the server has started you should be able to go to your localhost
on port 8000 "http://localhost:8000/" to verify that it works in your browser. Next up, navigate to the client/request-app folder and type "npm install" to install 
the React dependancies for the client to start. After the dependancies have been installed just type "npm start" and you should be automatically redirected to your
browser on "http://localhost:3000/".
